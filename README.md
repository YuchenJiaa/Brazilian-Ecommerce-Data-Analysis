# Brazilian-Ecommerce-Data-Analysis

In this project, I analyzed a dataset of one hundred thousand orders sourced from Kaggle. Using SQL, I performed various analyses to determine key events and extract meaningful insights from the data. And I tried to use cohort analysis to show the Repurchase Rate situation.

The project involved the following steps:

1. Data Exploration: I carefully examined the dataset, understanding its structure, and gaining insights into the available information, such as order details, customer information, and geographical data.
2. SQL Analysis: Leveraging SQL queries, I performed several analyses on the dataset to extract valuable information. Some of the key analyses conducted include:

  a. Repurchase Rate: Calculated the repurchase rate by identifying repeat orders from customers and determining the percentage of customers who made multiple purchases.
  
  b. Cohort Index: Using (orderYear - cohorYear) * 12 + (orderMonth - cohorMonth) as cohorIndex to be the horizontal axis of the cohort analysis chart.
  
  c. Top 5 Revenue by State: Identified the states generating the highest revenue by aggregating order values and ranking them to determine the top five states.
  
  d. Top 5 Popular Products by State: Analyzed product sales across different states to identify the top five popular products based on quantity sold.
  
  e. Active Users: Determined the count of active users.
  
  f. Average Cost by State: Calculated the average cost of orders in each state to analyze regional spending patterns.

Visualization with Tableau: Utilizing Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, I created compelling and interactive visualizations to present the analyzed insights effectively. The visualizations provided a clear understanding of the key events and patterns within the dataset.

By combining SQL analysis and Tableau visualizations, this project aimed to provide valuable insights into the dataset of one hundred thousand orders. The analyses conducted shed light on the repurchase rate, revenue generation by state, popular products by state, active user metrics, and average costs by state. The visualizations created in Tableau presented these findings in an engaging and understandable manner, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on the data.
